How to enable Ubuntu Pro Services in a Dockerfile
*************************************************

Ubuntu Pro comes with several services, some of which can be useful in Docker.
For example, Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) of packages and FIPS-certified
packages may be desirable in a Docker image. In this how-to guide, we show how
you can use the ``pro`` tool to take advantage of these services in your
Dockerfile.

Pre-requisites
==============

You should be running the latest version of Ubuntu Pro Client. You can
ensure that it is up to date by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update && sudo apt install ubuntu-pro-client

You should also build your Docker image on a host machine with an active Ubuntu
Pro subscription. If you are running an auto-attached cloud instance, then you
are already good to go. (See :ref:`How to attach <attach>` and
:ref:`About Public Cloud Ubuntu Pro images <expl-about-pro-cpc>` for more
details).

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo pro attach

Create an Ubuntu Pro Attach Config file
=======================================

.. attention::

   The Ubuntu Pro Attach Config file will contain your Ubuntu Pro Contract
   token and should be treated as a secret file.

An Attach Config file for ``pro`` is a YAML file that specifies some options
you want to invoke when running ``pro attach``. The file has two fields,
``token`` and ``enable_services`` and looks something like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   token: TOKEN
   enable_services:
   - service1
   - service2
   - service3

:``token``:
    The ``token`` field is required and must be set to an Ubuntu Pro token.
    You can retrieve a guest token on your Ubuntu Pro host by running the
    following command:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
       sudo pro api u.pro.attach.guest.get_guest_token.v1
    
    That command will output JSON that includes a guest token that is usable only once and valid for a
    short time, during which you can use it in your Docker build.
    
    .. tip::
       If you have ``jq`` installed, you can use the following command to extract the token:
        
       .. code-block:: bash
        
          sudo pro api u.pro.attach.guest.get_guest_token.v1 | jq -r '.data.attributes.guest_token'

:``enable_services``:
    The ``enable_services`` field value is a list of Ubuntu Pro service names. When
    it is set, then the services specified will be automatically enabled after
    attaching with your Ubuntu Pro token.
    
    Service names that you may be interested in enabling in your Docker builds
    include:
    
    - ``esm-infra``
    - ``esm-apps``
    - ``fips``
    - ``fips-updates``
    
    You can see a full list of the service names available by using the
    ``pro status --all`` command. You can then find out more about any of these
    services by running ``pro help service-name`` on any Ubuntu machine.

Create a Dockerfile to use ``pro`` and your Attach Config file
==============================================================

Your Dockerfile is going to look something like the following -- there are
inline comments explaining each line:

.. code-block:: dockerfile

   # Base on the LTS of your choice
   FROM ubuntu:focal

   # We mount a BuildKit secret here to access the attach config file which should
   # be kept separate from the Dockerfile and managed in a secure fashion since it
   # needs to contain your Ubuntu Pro token.
   # In the next step, we demonstrate how to pass the file as a secret when
   # running docker build.
   RUN --mount=type=secret,id=pro-attach-config \
      #
      # First we update apt so we install the correct versions of packages in
      # the next step
      apt-get update \
      #
      # Here we install `pro` (ubuntu-pro-client) as well as ca-certificates,
      # which is required to talk to the Ubuntu Pro authentication server securely.
      && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y ubuntu-pro-client ca-certificates \
      #
      # With pro installed, we attach using our attach config file from the
      # previous step
      && pro attach --attach-config /run/secrets/pro-attach-config \
      #
      ###########################################################################
      # At this point, the container has access to all Ubuntu Pro services
      # specified in the attach config file.
      ###########################################################################
      #
      # Always upgrade all packages to the latest available version with the Ubuntu Pro
      # services enabled.
      && apt-get upgrade -y \
      #
      # Then, you can install any specific packages you need for your docker
      # container.
      # Install them here, while Ubuntu Pro is enabled, so that you get the appropriate
      # versions.
      # Any `apt-get install ...` commands you have in an existing Dockerfile
      # that you may be migrating to use Ubuntu Pro should probably be moved here.
      && apt-get install -y openssl \
      #
      ###########################################################################
      # Now that we have upgraded and installed any packages from the Ubuntu Pro
      # services, we can clean up.
      ###########################################################################
      #
      # This detaches and purges ubuntu-pro-client, including all Ubuntu Pro
      # related secrets from the system.
      ###########################################################################
      # IMPORTANT: As written here, this command assumes your container does not
      # need ca-certificates so it is purged as well.
      # If your container needs ca-certificates, then do not purge it from the
      # system here.
      ###########################################################################
      && pro detach --assume-yes \
      && apt-get purge --auto-remove -y ubuntu-pro-client ca-certificates \
      #
      # Finally, we clean up the apt lists which should not be needed anymore
      # because any `apt-get install`s should have happened above. Cleaning these
      # lists keeps your image smaller.
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*


   # Now, with all of your Ubuntu apt packages installed, including all those
   # from Ubuntu Pro services, you can continue the rest of your app-specific Dockerfile.


An important point to note about the above Dockerfile is that all of the
``apt`` and ``pro`` commands happen inside one Dockerfile ``RUN`` instruction.
This is **critical** and must not be changed. Keeping everything as written
inside of one ``RUN`` instruction has two key benefits:

1. It prevents any Ubuntu Pro Subscription-related tokens and secrets from
   being leaked in an image layer.
2. It keeps the image as small as possible by cleaning up extra packages and
   files before the layer is finished.

.. note::

   These benefits could also be attained by squashing the image.

Build the Docker image
======================

Now, with our Attach Config file and Dockerfile created, we can build the image
with a command like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . --secret id=pro-attach-config,src=pro-attach-config.yaml -t ubuntu-focal-pro

There are two important pieces to this command.

1. We enable BuildKit with ``DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1``. This is necessary to support
   the secret mount feature.
2. We use the secret mount feature of BuildKit with
   ``--secret id=pro-attach-config,src=pro-attach-config.yaml``. This is what
   passes our Attach Config file in to be securely used by the
   ``RUN --mount=type=secret,id=pro-attach-config`` command in the Dockerfile.

Success
=======

Congratulations! At this point, you should have a Docker image that has been
built with Ubuntu Pro packages installed from whichever Ubuntu Pro service you
required.
